Assignment One Notes
================================================================================

1) We created a database and populated the Photos table with 10 nature photos.  The
nature view now shows those dynamically pulled photos.  Because we are not sure
we will be storing the photos in a table on the database -- you had mention 
pulling them from a folder location instead -- we did not implement this in our
other 3 subgallery views.

2) If you like, you can run the SQL script that generates the database and table.
It is located in the SoL/scripts/ folder.

3) The original web site has been put entirely inside the SoL/public/ folder or 
you can view the hosted version at http://www.cstprogram.ca/sliver

USE CASES:
================================================================================

1. Gallery/Blog Search

Actor: User

The user is browsing the website looking for a particular photo. They would
start by selecting the gallery page as starting point where all the photos might
be viewed. If the image(s) they are looking for do not appear on the top of
the list they would use the search button to attempt to find the one(s) they want.
This search button would provide a pop up overlay for the user to enter key words
to identify the photo types they wish to find. Upon hitting enter the overlay
will disappear and all the photos with tags to the search keywords will be displayed
in order of relevance. Thus the user's end goal of finding specific related photos
would be achieved.

The user is browsing the website looking at blog posts. Not all of them interest
the user. They want to filter out the ones that do not interest them while 
keeping the ones that do. Blog posts on the site will have associated tags. 
On the blog page there will be a filter of some sort that allows a user to select 
or deselect tags. This will filter the bogs to only include the selected tags, 
allowing for quick sorting and maintaining user interest and site flow.


2. Gallery View

Actor: User

The user enters the site looking to view the photos by the photographer. Starting
at the home page they navigate to the Gallery page using the navigation bar. Then
they may select sub galleries to view photos. Photos are loaded dynamically.


3. Blog View

Actor: User

The user enters the site looking to view the blogs by the photographer. Starting
at the home page they navigate to the Blog page using the navigation bar. Then
they may view the blogs and add comments using facebook/twitter accounts. 
Blogs are loaded dynamically.


4. Admin model

Actor: Admin/owner of web site

The admin/owner can login to an admin module and from there can monitor user posts
add/delete new blog posts and photos, and edit existing blog posts.



SITE MAP:
================================================================================

You can find a PDF with a diagram showing how the site (from the user/viewer)
standpoint is laid out.  The admin side would have a different UI and controls.

The PDF is located inside the main SoL directory and called "SoL_sitemap.pdf".
Or if you prefer, you can click on the link below to view it:
