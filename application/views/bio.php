        <p>Photography, for me, is like a pursuit of perfection, of that ideal photo that is well composed, captures the magic of light, conveys a story, and evokes an emotion, whether it be positive or negative.

        <br>I love exploring new subjects, and I’ll shoot pretty much anything. These days I’m drawn to fine art long exposure photography and capturing urban lifestyles with a more street photography approach.

        <br>I'm fascinated with the natural world and how things work. I think beauty can be found not only in spectacular vistas and colourful landscapes but also in the nitty, gritty details and realities of city life.

        <br>I’m always interested in a new project, and I love collaborating with other artists, so feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>!
